{"gold_answer": "3", "final_answer": "3", "reasoning": "To determine the total number of bolts of fiber the boxed takes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the number of bolts of blue fiber the boxed takes. According to the problem, the boxed takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n2. Determine the number of bolts of white fiber the boxed takes. The problem states that the boxed takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the boxed takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it takes \\(\\frac{2}{2} = 1\\) bolt of white fiber.\n3. Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber by adding the number of bolts of blue fiber and the number of bolts of white fiber.

Determine the increased value of the house after the repairs.\n3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the increased value.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house after repairs.**\n\nThe original cost of the house is $80,000. Josh spends an additional $50,000 on repairs. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the increased value of the house after the repairs.**\n\nThe repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. This means the increased value is 150% of the original cost of the house plus the cost of the repairs. First, we need to find 150% of the original cost of the house:\n\\[ 150\\% \\text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \\times 80,000 = 120,000 \\]\n\nThe increased value of the house is the original cost plus the cost of the repairs plus the increase in value:\n\\[ 80,000 + 50,000 + 120,000 = 250,000 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**\n\nThe profit is the increased value of the house minus the total cost:\n\\[ 250,000 - 130,000 = 120,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the profit Josh made is:\n\\[ \\boxed{120000} \\]"}

Compare the remaining money with the amount he has left to find out how many lego sets he still has.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of money John made from selling his lego sets.\n   John sold 13 lego sets at $15 each.\n   \\[\n   13 \\times 15 = 195\n   \\]\n   So, John made $195 from selling the lego sets.\n\n2. Determine how much money John spent on the video games.\n   John bought 8 video games at $20 each.\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 20 = 160\n   \\]\n   So, John spent $160 on the video games.\n\n3. Find out how much money John had initially before buying the video games.\n   John has $5 left after buying the video games. Therefore, the initial amount of money he had is the amount he spent on the video games plus the amount he has left.\n   \\[\n   160 + 5 = 165\n   \\]\n   So, John initially had $165.\n\n4. Subtract the amount of money John spent on the video games from the initial amount to find out how much money he had left.\n   We already know that John has $5 left after buying the video games.\n\n5. Compare the remaining money with the amount he has left to find out how many lego sets he still has.\n   Since John has $5 left and he initially had $165, the amount of money he has left is the same as the amount he has left after buying the video games. This means he has not sold any more lego sets, so he still has all 13 lego sets he originally had.\n\nTherefore, the number of lego sets John still has is \\boxed{0}."}
